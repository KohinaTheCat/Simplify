## Simplify :pen:

<p align="center">
     Simplify is a Chrome Extension that summarizes any article you're reading in just one click! 
     <br/>
     The Chrome Extension calls on an API that was made and deployed on Herkou to get the summary of the article.

## Motivation

>  The advent of the 21st century has ushered in the information era. Our race has evolved to process mountains of information every day. However, the attention spans of future generations are steadily decreasing. To combat this, we have created Simplify, an innovative tool that allows humans to process large amounts of information at lightning speeds.
